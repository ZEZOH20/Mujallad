        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          At Mujallad, we believe a book cover is more than just protectionâ€”it's the first impression,
          a statement of what lies within, and a work of art in its own right.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Each cover is meticulously crafted using sustainable materials and traditional bookbinding techniques,
          combined with contemporary design sensibilities.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-8">
          Our artisans pour their expertise into every stitch, every emboss, ensuring your book stands as a
          testament to quality and beauty.
